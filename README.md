# Hello There!ðŸ‘‹

I'm Randy, a CS student just trying to do cool things. Whether it's making the [everything](https://github.com/stuysu/epsilon) app for my school, making it big on [https://www.youtube.com/@GandyDev](https://www.youtube.com/@GandyDev), or ~~launching a B2B SaaS~~ changing the world, I strive to be obsessed with my endeavors and meet cool people :).
